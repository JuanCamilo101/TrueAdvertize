Add more detail about:
- CRM cleanup & enrichment
- ICP analysis from existing data
- Revenue per rep optimization

### Option 3: Add Use Cases Section
Show specific scenarios:

Add testimonial specifically about systems/CRM work, not just leads

## KEY QUOTE FROM MD COPY (Often Missed):

> "They don't always need MORE leads. They need BETTER systems."
>
> "Their CRM is chaos. They lose track of opportunities. They don't know who closes and who doesn't. They don't prioritize. They don't do research at scale. They're drowning in leads but starving for revenue."

This is a POWERFUL differentiation point that's not on the landing page!
